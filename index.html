      <p>
        Rowhammer is a vulnerability in DRAM devices that allows for attacks such as privilege escalation and sandbox escaping.
        Repeatedly accessing a row in recent DRAM devices can cause bit flips in adjacent rows, and attacks <a href="http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html">demonstrated and documented</a> by the Google Project Zero team have used this behavior to gain kernel prileges on x86-64 Linux machines (from unprivileged user-land).
      </p>
      <p>
        The x86 exploit utilizes repeated CLFUSH instructions to induce bit-flipping and gain read-write access to all of physical memory. However, the Google team believes this vulnerability to exist on other machines and operating systems. This is because the vulnerability is a result of the increasing density of DRAM devices; since the individual cells are packed closer together, the electrical charge sent to one row has a greater chance of effecting the cells in adjacent rows as well.
